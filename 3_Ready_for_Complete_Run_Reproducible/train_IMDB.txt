Quicksilver had been discussed previously as a potential character in both X-Men: The Last Stand (2006) and The Avengers (2012), but legal complexities over the license to the character resulted in his omission from both films. However, in May 2013 both Marvel and Fox Studios announced a resolution to the previous legal issues, and that Quicksilver would appear in this film as well as an Avengers sequel, though under certain parameters: no reference to Quicksilver's membership in the Avengers can be made in an ""X-Men"" film, and no allusion to his relations to the X-Men or Magneto (the character's father) can be made in an ""Avengers"" film; the rights agreement between Fox and Marvel even goes so far as to stipulate the character cannot be referred to as a ""mutant"" in any Marvel film. Additionally, the day after the announcement of Peters's casting, Marvel and Fox entered into a legal standoff over provisions of the rights agreement for the character, including the issue of whether Peters would be allowed to portray Quicksilver in any other film outside the ""X-Men"" franchise, possibly necessitating a second actor to play Quicksilver in any Marvel film, resulting in two different versions of the same character appearing in two competing film series. Ultimately, Fox and Marvel decided to cast different actors in the part for the ""X-Men"" and ""Avengers"" films, with Aaron Taylor-Johnson taking on the role in the latter sequel, thus preventing any connection between the two franchises and keeping the X-Men confined to a separate universe from those of the Marvel cinematic universe.

Early ideas included an opening with the Kennedy assassination being caused by Magneto, and mutant encounters set in the Civil rights movement/the Vietnam War. When Singer took over, he integrated these concepts into a viral marketing campaign to set up the action of the film. In this alternate history, Magneto is arrested and imprisoned for the assassination of Kennedy, but maintains his innocence. The ""Bent Bullet"" Theory (a reference to the real life ""Magic Bullet"" Theory criticized by conspiracy theorists) holds that the Warren Commission determined that Magneto manipulated Lee Harvey Oswald's bullets to kill the President in retribution for the murder of the mutants Azazel and Tempest (from X-Men: First Class (2011), though in the film Tempest was codenamed Angel) by the CIA. Conspiracy theorists, based on Magneto's testimony, insist however that Magneto had tried to prevent the murder of Kennedy, and that the true shooter was not Oswald, but Mystique in disguise who, with the help of Emma Frost (also from ""First Class"") framed Magneto, and manipulated Jack Ruby into later murdering Oswald. The theory also posits that Mystique offered to double as Kennedy in an attempt to grab power, all of which backfired horribly, leading to anti-mutant hostilities.

3	Interstellar (2014) 	"There are 15 differences from Steven Spielberg's unproduced version of Interstellar and this one:-Murph was male.-A fallen space probe brings Cooper to NASA.-The Lazarus Mission never occurred and instead, a series of space probes were sent through the wormhole to transmit data.-The wormhole was tiny and sphere-shaped so the crew suffers from distortion while going through it.-The mission only travels to the ice planet.-Cooper finds a dusty Chinese base camp on the planet so the Chinese had already discovered the ice planet 30 years prior with a 4 man crew & 15 robots.-They find a laboratory containing a machine, which when turned on reverses the gravity inside the room.-Professor Brand has spent his whole life trying to solve the gravity equation which would allow Earth to launch a space station saving the lives of many people on the planet. The original story never had scientists on Earth looking to solve such an issue and the NASA base was not built in a centrifuge space station.-Instead of the evil Dr. Mann showing up, there are aliens and bad robots.-Everyone on Earth dies but the story does not cut away to show what is happening on Earth.-The original story takes place entirely from Cooper's point of view. We never see any of the story elements of Murph & Prof. Brand back at home. The original story loses the emotional connection between father & daughter and instead explores much more fully the relationship of Cooper & Brand as it grows.-A second wormhole is discovered through the Chinese crew's logs. They also eventually encounter orb distortions, possibly creatures that can only interact using gravity.-The ship finds a space station built outside of space & time. It is an opening leading to the view of the entire universe compressed into a flattened disc. It is implied that they are now outside of space & time, looking from some kind of fifth dimension.-They also discover a time traveling wormhole the Chinese robots found that goes back to earth but to a different time, a few years after they had left. It's unclear though if the Chinese made it back.-Cooper arrives back on Earth, two hundred years after he has left and humanity is completely gone from the planet.

It's because, to us, it represents the movie. Frozen plays on the level of ice and snow but also the frozen relationship, the frozen heart that has to be thawed. We don't think of comparisons between Tangled and Frozen, though. The decision to call the film Frozen was the filmmaker's decision. The studio's decision to then call it the Snow Queen overseas was because that just resonated stronger in some countries than Frozen. Maybe there's a richness to the Snow Queen in the country's heritage and they just wanted to emphasize that."" As he continued to make his statement, ""We're telling a story about family and relationships and that in itself can be very complicated. A lot of times what you perceive something to be isn't what it turns out to be - Elsa has to hide for her whole life who she is, even from her sister. That clearly affected her and made her into the character she is. Hopefully, if you look at the story through Elsa's eyes, you'll be able to understand what she does, or if you look at it through Anna's eyes, you'll be able to understand why she does what she does, but they're all complicated relationships. We don't think of it as a Princess movie. They happen to be Princesses, but we don't think about it that way, so I always get a bit thrown when people talk about this. But I can say we want to make them really believable and not set them up on a pedestal.

Tyson wrote a letter to James Cameron explaining the error; several years later, upon meeting Cameron in person, Tyson repeated his complaint; and then at an event that occurred at the Hayden Planetarium, Tyson spoke about it to Cameron a third time. Finally, a post-production technician working on the re-release called Tyson and asked him to provide a picture of what the sky really would have looked like, and Tyson's star image was used to fix that shot.

After DeHaan lost 7 lbs in a single day, the film's medic was so concerned that DeHaan would get heat stroke, that crew members were told to pour buckets of ice on DeHaan's head and down his suit between takes. Unfortunately, this didn't work because his body temperature was so high that the ice would melt and turn into steam before he could feel the cooling effects. Eventually, a tubing system that would pump cold water was installed in the goblin suit so that the cooler temperatures could reach DeHaan's body.

During this extended stay of seclusion, Ledger delved deep into the psychology of the character. He devoted himself to developing The Joker's every tic, namely the voice and that sadistic-sounding laugh (for the voice, Ledger's goal was to create a tone that didn't echo the work Jack Nicholson did in his 1989 performance as the Joker). Ledger's interpretation of The Joker's appearance was primarily based on the chaotic, disheveled look of punk rocker Sid Vicious combined with the psychotic mannerisms of Malcolm McDowell's character, Alex De Large, from A Clockwork Orange (1971).

He could be funny and make you laugh. Heath's gone in a completely different direction to Jack, he's like a really scary psychopath. He's a lovely guy and his Joker is going to be a hell of a revelation in this picture."" Caine bases this belief on a scene where the Joker pays a visit to Bruce Wayne's penthouse. He'd never met Ledger before, so when Ledger arrived and performed he gave Caine such a fright he forgot his lines.

When he returned to work, he was fascinated to find that nobody would mention or acknowledge his injuries, instead saying such commonplace things as ""How was your weekend?"" Palahniuk concluded that the reason people reacted this way was because if they asked him what had happened, a degree of personal interaction would be necessary, and his workmates simply didn't care enough to connect with him on a personal level.

Both Norton and Pitt felt that this kind of corporate selling out was exactly what the film was railing against, hence the inclusion of the car; ""It's a perfect example of the Baby Boomer generation marketing its youth culture to us. As if our happiness is going to come by buying the symbol of their youth movement, even with the little flower holder in the plastic molding. It's appalling to me. I hate it.""

They include: A longer opening scene and introduction to Bane, where the character gives a speech espousing his ideology which echos that of Ra's Al Guhl in Batman Begins (2005);A longer speech by the Mayor, explaining the powers of the Dent Act and an elaborate police search for Batman which drove Bruce Wayne into exile;A scene at Wayne Manor where the Congressman tells Foley that he's next in line for the role of Police Commissioner, setting up the conflict between Gordon and Foley and Foley's obsession with arresting Batman for the murder of Harvey Dent;A conversation between Miranda & Daggett where she refers to the false power of his wealth, hinting at her true identity as Talia;A conversation between the two thugs that capture Commissioner Gordon where they debate killing him before taking him to Bane (explaining how Gordon learned Bane's name)A scene at Wayne Enterprises where Miranda warns Lucius Fox that Daggett is trying to take control of the company;A longer scene of Bruce Wayne and Lucius Fox at the Applied Sciences warehouse. Fox gives Wayne the special leg brace which allows him to walk again. Their conversation also establishes that while the Applied Sciences equipment and weaponry is kept ""off the books,"" the warehouse is not. This explains how Bane knows the location of the armory, as its location had not changed since the events of Batman Begins (2005);A longer conversation between Batman and Gordon in the hospital. Gordon warns Batman that the truth about Harvey Dent will eventually be uncovered sending the city into upheaval;A scene between Selina and Jen at their apartment implying they are both prostitutes, and that Selina is instructing Jen how to be a thief to get out of the hooker lifestyle;Scenes of Bruce Wayne trailing Selina to Miranda Tate's costume party;Bruce testing the leg brace in the Batcave, explaining to Alfred how it works to match the muscle patterns of his uninjured leg;A much longer scene outside the stock exchange and a lengthy chase scene between Bane, the police and Batman where they race around Gotham. The trimming of these scenes accounts for the somewhat abrupt day-to-night shift in the final film;An argument in the Batcave between Bruce and Alfred revealing that Bruce bought up all the land and homes surrounding Wayne Manor to prevent anyone from seeing him coming and going as Batman;An extended, much more heated confrontation between Bruce and Alfred. Alfred threatens to leave Wayne Manor if Bruce continues as Batman and Bruce argues that since Rachel Dawes's death, Batman is his only reason to live. Alfred confesses that he burned Rachel's letter and lied about her choosing to marry Bruce. Bruce accuses Alfred of betrayal before Alfred gives his speech about protecting Bruce's life, which does appear in the final film;A longer conversation between Bruce, Miranda & Fox discussing the reactor and Dr. Pavel;An extended conversation between Bruce & Blake where Blake warns Bruce that others will eventually figure out Batman's true identity. Blake also jokingly gives Bruce cash for cab fare.A longer scene in Gordon's hospital room. Gordon orders Foley to focus on capturing Bane, not Batman, then promotes Blake from beat cop to detective.A slightly longer love scene between Bruce and Miranda where she explains her scar--the same as Bane's--resulted from a mistake in her past;A speech by Bane when he delivers Bruce to the Pit Prison, explaining how hope is the cause of despair;A scene of Blake telling Gordon and Foley that Bane may have killed Batman. Foley then apologizes to Blake for not listening to him sooner.A conversation between Blake and Gordon where Blake plots out all of Daggett's construction work on a map of Gotham City before he confronts the construction workers;A much extended scene of Bane storming Blackgate Prison. Bane burns a picture of Harvey Dent and explains that Dent became the villain Two-Face after his injuries and encourages the city's poor to attack the wealthy and powerful before he destroys Blackgate, releasing all the inmates;A brief scene of Selina escaping Blackgate;An expanded conversation in the Pit between Bruce, his Prisoner caretaker and the blind prison doctor establishing that Bruce's back is -not- broken, but that he has a dislocated vertebrae. The Prisoner also explains the significance of Bane's mask as a painkiller delivery system;A scene of Bruce gathering supplies in the Pit as he prepares to climb out without the rope;A brief conversation between Fox and Bruce establishing that he purposely hid The Bat under camouflage on a rooftop instead of the Batcave to prevent Bane from finding it;A series of extended or omitted scenes showing how the city reacts to the burning Bat-signal on Gotham Bridge. Most significantly, Bane's army of mercenaries begins to panic and is demoralized;An extended battle outside City Hall. Bane orders his men not to attack Batman, determined to fight him alone;An extensive flashback sequence after Batman defeats Bane. Bane confesses that his devotion to Ra's Al Guhl stems from the League of Shadows rescuing him from the pit. A flashback scene then shows Ra's Al Guhl training Bane, who he has provided with a crude prototype mask to numb his pain;A scene of Talia openly taking charge of the League of Shadows to form a convoy to detonate the neutron bomb. She then floods the reactor core and, as in the film, Fox tries to escape, though even the finished scenes of fox in the film occur earlier in the script version;A longer argument between Blake and the Army blockade on Gotham Bridge. Blake argues with the commanding officer, trying to convince him that Batman has returned and battle has broken out in the city streets.In the script, after Batman harnesses the bomb to The Bat, he's never seen again--The Bat simply flies out to sea and the bomb detonates. The scene of Fox and the technicians examining the autopilot of The Bat then follows, with Fox realizing that Batman had ejected before the bomb detonated, and that Bruce Wayne must have survived the explosion.

The author initially refused, citing the film as a reason why she would never again allow an adaptation of her ""Mary Poppins"" series. After several meetings, the author relented, though when Mackintosh suggested using the songs from the Walt Disney film in the production, Travers again balked. After much more pleading, Mackintosh convinced Travers to allow a stage production with the songs from the film on the strict proviso that no Americans participate in the development, and further that no one involved with the film version--including original film composers Robert B. Sherman and Richard M. Sherman, both of whom were still alive and working in 1994--could participate. Mackintosh proceeded with development of the stage adaptation for several years without any involvement from Disney, per Travers' wishes, though after the author's death in 1996, the Walt Disney Company was allowed some degree of creative involvement and went on to co-produce the musical with Mackintosh.

25	Saving Mr. Banks (2013) 	"According to the 40th Anniversary DVD release of Mary Poppins (1964) in 2004, Walt Disney first attempted to purchase the film rights to Mary Poppins from P.L. Travers as early as 1938, but was rebuffed because Travers was disgusted by Hollywood's handling of book-to-film adaptations, and did not believe a film version of her books would do justice to her creation. Another reason for her initial rejection would have been that at that time the Disney studios had not yet produced a live action film. For more than twenty years, Disney made periodic entreaties to Travers to allow him to make a Poppins film. He finally succeeded in 1961, but Travers demanded and got script-approval rights. Planning the film, writing the script and composing the songs took about two years. Travers objected to a number of elements that actually made it into the film. Rather than Robert B. Sherman and Richard M. Sherman's original songs, she wanted the soundtrack to feature known standards of the Edwardian period in which the story is set. Travers also objected to the idea of using animation to depict the chalkboard world. Disney overruled her, citing contract stipulations that he had final say on the finished print. Travers refused to allow any other Mary Poppins books to be filmed, even though Walt tried very hard to get her to reconsider.

'Alan Horn', Chairman of the Walt Disney Studios, didn't believe any other studio could have made Saving Mr. Banks. ""Why would Paramount make a movie about Walt Disney?"" he asked.

The story goes that when the Devil takes a person's soul, it is removed through the back of the head (this isn't part of any known religion, but this is what the message board posters say). When we see the back of Marcellus's head he has a Band-Aid covering the precise spot indicated by tradition for soul removal. Perhaps Marcellus sold his soul to the devil which would also explain why the combination to open the briefcase is 666.Quentin Tarantino has said that the band-aid on the back of Marsellus Wallace's neck had nothing to do with an allusion to the Devil stealing Marsellus's soul... but that the actor Ving Rhames had a scar on the back of his neck he wanted to cover up.Or could it be simply a 20-watt light bulb?According to Roger Avary, who co-wrote the script with Quentin Tarantino, the original plan was to have the briefcase contain diamonds. This seemed neither exciting nor original, so Avary and Tarantino decided to have the briefcase's contents never appear on screen; this way each film-goer could mentally ""fill in the blank"" with whatever struck his or her imagination as best fitting the description ""so beautiful"". The orange light bulb (projecting shimmering light onto the actors' faces) was a last-minute decision and added a completely unintended fantastic element.In a radio interview with Howard Stern in late 2003, Quentin Tarantino was asked by a caller the contents of the briefcase, and he answered, ""It's whatever the viewer wants it to be.""

Never using the drug himself, director Quentin Tarantino had Travolta research his character's addiction by speaking to a recovering heroin addict that he (Quentin) knew personally. Travolta asked Tarantino's friend to tell him how could he know what it felt like to be on heroin (without actually using it of course). Tarantino's friend explained ""If you want to get the 'bottom envelope' feeling of that, get plastered on Tequila, and lie down in a hot pool. Then you will have barely touched the feeling of what it might be like to be on heroin."" John Travolta then explained that he was ecstatic to tell his wife that he was ""told"" in order to research aspects of his upcoming roles' character, he had to get plastered on Tequila and lie in a hot pool.

The movie conformed to the book: the platforms seen as 9 and 10 are in real life inter-city platforms 4 and 5. However, there is, in fact a ""Platform 9 3/4"" at King's Cross. It's located in the walkway area between the real platforms 9 and 10, as a treat for fans of Harry Potter.

To do that, Lubezki decided he needed to light the actors' faces to match the all-digital environment. Whether the characters were floating gently, changing direction or tumbling in vacuum, the facial light would need to perfectly match Earth, Sol and the other stars in the background. ""That can break easily,"" explains Lubezki, ""if the light is not moving at the speed that it has to move, if the position of the light is not right, if the contrast or density on the faces is wrong."" Lubezki suggested folding an L.E.D. screen into a box, putting the actor inside, and using the light from the screen to light the actor. That way, rather than moving either Sandra Bullock or George Clooney in the middle of static lights, the projected image could move while they stayed still. The ""light box"", key to the space-walk scenes was a nine-foot cube just big enough for one actor.

47	The Breakfast Club (1985) 	"John Hughes originally wanted ""The Breakfast Club"" to be a 2-1/2 hour movie. However, many of the scenes were cut out and the negatives destroyed. John Hughes said in Première that he had the only complete copy of The Breakfast Club on film. Among the cut scenes from the movie (some filmed, some only written) are: -Carl predicts where the five kids will be in 30 years. Bender will have killed himself, Claire will have had ""2 boob jobs and a face lift,"" Brian will have become very successful but die of a heart attack due to the stress of the high paying job. Allison will be a great poet but no one will care, and Andrew will marry a gorgeous airline stewardess who will become fat after having kids. -In a dream sequence, Allison imagines Andrew as a gluttonous Viking, Bender as a prisoner, Claire as a bride, Brian as an astronaut, and herself as a vampire. In an unfilmed alternative to this dream sequence, all five kids imagine random things, including cars, naked women, Godzilla, beer, and fighter planes, and these things end up filling the room until Vernon interrupts. -John Bender was not going to walk to school in the original script. He was going to be driven by his dad in a rusty tow truck, and have a brief fight with him before his dad drives off. Bender also tossed a bagged lunch, his father saying ""You are a waste of lunch meat!"" -After Bender demonstrates ""Life at Big Bri's house"" Brian stops Bender and corrects him with a much more pessimistic version of the skit. Claire then proceeds to act out her life before asking Bender to demonstrate his version. Bender's routine changes as well here. After Bender mimics his mom, he stops, commenting that ""then they make me work to pay off the dentist for the teeth HE busts."" -The scene where Andrew and Allison are walking to get the sodas is extended to a point where Allison pulls out a pack of cigarettes and smokes one. -After getting the sodas, Bender shakes his can violently and places it among the five to see who gets the rigged one. Allison ends up getting it, and when she opens the can, all the soda squirts directly into her mouth. -After Vernon asks who has to use the lavatory, the five go to the bathroom. Vernon gives the boys 2 minutes and the girls 3 minutes. Claire catches Allison in a stall eating a bag of chips, repulsing her. Bender mocks Brian for sitting down to pee instead of using a urinal. -Several staff members were cut out of the script before filming. Dr. Lange, a social studies teacher who dresses oddly, and Robin, a gym teacher. Robin helps Vernon on a few workout machines until Vernon injures his back, and she eventually visits the students while they are in their circle in the library. Robin initially replaced many of Carl's scenes and Carl was originally set to be a minor character with only 2 scenes.

Emilio Estevez was enraged by the remark, and Kapelos was then stunned to learn that Martin Sheen was Estevez's father. While Estevez accepted Kapelos' apology and filming was unaffected, Kapelos said years later he still felt terrible about what he said, even though he hadn't had any idea about the connection between Sheen and Estevez and had offended Estevez completely inadvertently. When Kapelos guest-starred on The West Wing (1999) in 1999, he told Martin Sheen this story. Sheen thought it was very funny, which provided Kapelos a small amount of relief from the chagrin he had felt about the incident since it happened.

47	The Breakfast Club (1985) 	"At the beginning of the movie, there are some shots of the school building right before the kids show up for detention. Written on a wall is, ""I don't like Mondays"". This refers to a school shooting in 1979 committed by 16-year-old Brenda Spencer. Brenda's father gave her a rifle for Christmas in 1978. On January 29th, 1979, she used her new rifle to shoot 10 children and staff at Clevelend Elementary School in San Diego, California. The school was across the street from her house, where she was during the incident. She killed the school's principal and one of the custodians, and injured 8 children. After 6 hours, she was apprehended by police. When asked why she did it, she said ""I don't like Mondays. This livens up the day."" As for selecting her targets, she said ""I like red and blue jackets."" As of April, 2009, she is serving a life sentence, and has been denied parole 4 times. At her 2005 parole hearing, she claimed that her father had sexually abused her as a child, and that she was drunk and on PCP at the time of the shooting. According to her, the authorities and her attorney conspired to hide the drug test results. As for remorse, she said at the time ""I had no reason for it, and it was just a lot of fun"", ""It was just like shooting ducks in a pond"", and ""[The children] looked like a herd of cows standing around; it was really easy pickings.""

The first documented use of the phrase in this way is from John Milton's 1634 work ""Comus I."" A ""Playbook"" is a written or mental list of athletic strategies that a coach creates to guide a team through a game or a sport. So in combination, the title refers to an arsenal of strategies for Pat to use while trying to look on the brighter side of life. Similar expressions were used in foreign releases, such as: ""The Bright Side of Things"", ""The Bright Side of Life"", or ""Games of Destiny"" (Spain/Latin America), ""Optimistic Guide"" (Greece), ""Happiness Therapy"" (France), ""Guide for Ultimate Happiness"" (Portugal), ""My Light of Hope"" (Turkey), and ""Sunny Side"" (Hungary) to name a few.

58	The Spy Who Loved Me (1977) 	"The Spy Who Loved Me was the tenth James Bond novel to be written by Ian Fleming. It was first published on 18 April 1962. The only common story elements between the novel and the film are its title and two henchman Jaws and Sandor who are loosely inspired by the book's villains Horror (with steel-capped teeth) and Slugsy (short and bald). The film is considered as the first Bond film whose story is completely original. (The second would be GoldenEye (1995).) Fleming only allowed the novel's title to be used as it was told in the first person of a Bond girl character, with James Bond himself only appearing in chapters 10-14 out of 15. The names of the heroine (Vivienne Michel) and the villains' employer (Mr. Saguinetti) are not mentioned in the movie. The novelization of the film by screenwriter Christopher Wood was called ""James Bond, The Spy Who Loved Me"" so as to distinguish it from Fleming's novel. This was the first novelization of a Bond film, rather than the other way around. Some later Bond movies, namely Moonraker (1979), A View to a Kill (1985) and Quantum of Solace (2008), followed the example of using a one of Fleming's titles and creating a wholly or mostly new story for it.

Jackson. It was accomplished by Marine Pvt. Carlos Hathcock during the Vietnam War. Hathcock was a sniper who was being fired at by a concealed Viet Cong sniper. He finally managed to catch a glimpse of the man's sniperscope and put a round through it, killing him. The similar sequence in this film is rumored to be a tribute to Hathcock, who has been regarded as one of the US' most famous snipers. Although Hathcock's shot was only at 100 yards. Jackson's was said in the film to be at over 400 yards. At that distance the bullet is falling at a much steeper angle, even with a modern sniper rifle, making the shot impossible at that distance.

Initially, she considered various actors for the role of Patrick Bateman, including Billy Crudup (who was offered the part but turned it down), Ben Chaplin, Robert Sean Leonard, Johnathon Schaech, Jonny Lee Miller, and Jared Leto. Eventually, Harron offered the part to Christian Bale, who accepted. The producers tried to talk Harron into casting Edward Norton, but she refused, and was ultimately allowed to cast Bale, but only on the proviso that she cast at least two other big name actors in supporting roles. To this end, Harron hired Willem Dafoe to play Kimball and Reese Witherspoon to play Evelyn. However, after they had agreed to appear, Lions Gate told Harron they were going to make an offer to Leonardo DiCaprio to play Bateman. Harron told them if they did, she would leave the project, which is exactly what happened. Oliver Stone was subsequently hired to replace Harron, working from a script by Matt Markwalder. Stone was set to cast James Woods as Kimball, Cameron Diaz as Evelyn, Elizabeth Berkley as Courtney and Chloë Sevigny as Jean. Stone also decided to keep Leto on the project as Paul Allen. However, DiCaprio left the project to shoot The Beach (2000) instead, and as the budget began to get out of control, Stone also left, prompting Lions Gate to rehire Harron, who returned to her original castings decisions, and decided to keep Sevigny on the project.

Zemeckis and Gale then cast Eric Stoltz as Marty based on his performance in Mask (1985). After four weeks of filming Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale felt that Stoltz wasn't right for the part and Stoltz agreed. By this stage, Baxter was back fully on the show and Goldberg agreed to let Fox go off to make the film. Fox worked out a schedule to fulfill his commitment to both projects. Every day during production, he drove straight to the movie set after taping of the show was finished every day and averaged about five hours of sleep. The bulk of the production was filmed from 6pm to 6am, with the daylight scenes filmed on weekends. Reshooting Stoltz's scenes added $3 million dollars to the budget.

Joel Coen & Ethan Coen later admitted that they added that disclaimer so the viewer would be more willing to suspend disbelief in the story. (An urban legend even says that people have gone to search Minnesota for the briefcase of money, and come to a bad end.) While the specific crimes in the movie didn't happen, the plot has elements of two well-known Minnesota crimes. In 1962, a St. Paul attorney named Eugene Thompson hired someone to kill his wife, Carol. Unbeknownst to Thompson, his man hired someone else to do the job. The second man fatally wounded Mrs. Thomspon in her house, but she managed to escape him. She went to a neighbor's house for help while her assailant fled the scene. The sloppiness and brutality of the crime attracted great attention. The murderers were quickly caught and gave up Thompson, who denied knowing anything about the crime for many years afterward. In 1972, Virginia Piper, the wife of a wealthy Orono banker, was kidnapped. A million-dollar ransom was paid, one of the largest in U.S. history. Mrs. Piper was found tied to a tree in a state park. Two men were convicted of the crime, but were acquitted after a re-trial. One of them later went on a shooting spree after his wife left him, killing her, their 5-year-old son, her son from a previous marriage, her new boyfriend, and one of his sons. Only $4,000 of the money was ever recovered.

Here is the truth. In my obit it will say that I wrote it. People don't want to think those two cute guys wrote it. What happened was, they had the script. It was their script. They gave it to Rob [Reiner] to read, and there was a great deal of stuff in the script dealing with the F.B.I. trying to use Matt Damon for spy work because he was so brilliant in math. Rob said, ""Get rid of it."" They then sent them in to see me for a day - I met with them in New York - and all I said to them was, ""Rob's right. Get rid of the F.B.I. stuff. Go with the family, go with Boston, go with all that wonderful stuff."" And they did. I think people refuse to admit it because their careers have been so far from writing, and I think it's too bad. I'll tell you who wrote a marvelous script once, Sylvester Stallone. Rocky's a marvelous script. God, read it, it's wonderful. It's just got marvelous stuff. And then he stopped suddenly because it's easier being a movie star and making all that money than going in your pit and writing a script. But I did not write [Good Will Hunting], alas. I would not have written the ""It's not your fault"" scene. I'm going to assume that 148 percent of the people in this room have seen a therapist. I certainly have, for a long time. Hollywood always has this idea that it's this shrink with only one patient. I mean, that scene with Robin Williams gushing and Matt Damon and they're hugging, ""It's not your fault, it's not your fault."" I thought, Oh God, Freud is so agonized over this scene. But Hollywood tends to do that with therapists.""

Walt Disney Pictures was enthusiastic to purchase the remake rights, but Goldwyn instead chose New Line Cinema, who held a positive working relationship with Carrey on Dumb &amp; Dumber (1994) and The Mask (1994). The studio bought the rights in 1995 with the understanding that The Samuel Goldwyn Company would be involved in creative decisions. Babaloo Mandel and Lowell Ganz (writers of Parenthood (1989) and A League of Their Own (1992)) turned in the first draft of the screenplay in July 1997. Ron Howard entered negotiations to direct that same month, as well as cover producing duties with Brian Grazer and Imagine Entertainment. Howard, Grazer, and Imagine Entertainment eventually left the project in favor of Edtv (1999), and the Mitty project languished in development hell over the challenges of using a contemporary storyline.

In November 2002 New Line was forced to revert the film rights back to Goldwyn, who won his lawsuit and took the property to Paramount Pictures. During pre-production discussions between Paramount and DreamWorks Pictures on Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events (2004) (which starred Jim Carrey), Steven Spielberg, head of DreamWorks, rekindled interest in working with Carrey; the duo previously considered Meet the Parents (2000), but the outing fell apart.

If the man pulls this lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks, but the man notices that there is one person on the side track.

100	Lone Survivor (2013) 	"Gregory ""Rocky"" Rockwood was one of the crewmembers awarded the 2004 Mackay Trophy for the ""most meritorious flight of the year"" by an Air Force person, persons, or organization. Jolly 11 and Jolly 12 crewmembers distinguished themselves by gallantry in connection with rescue operations near Kharbut, Iraq, on 16 April 2004. While supporting of Operation Iraqi Freedom, Jolly 11 Flight launched to rescue a five person crew of a U.S. Army CH-47 Chinook that crashed in a sandstorm with near zero-visibility. En route to the crash scene, crews realized their forward looking infra-red and night vision goggles were ineffective. Despite this handicap the crew of Jolly 11 was able to locate the survivors. Both aircraft then made near zero-visibility approaches relying nearly exclusively on the flight engineers and aerial gunners inputs for precision navigation. Following the successful survivor contacts and recovery by the Flight's Pararescuemen, Jolly 11 and Jolly 12 were individually engaged by separate multiple surface-to-air missiles attacks. Using evasive maneuvers Jolly 11 evaded two missiles. Both Jolly 11 and Jolly 12 continued to provide support with defensive fire until the formation was clear of the threat area saving the lives of five U.S. Army personnel.

They were named Pamela One, Pamela Two and Pamela Three, after the character Pam Bouvier (Carey Lowell) in the movie. 5 Others were simply modified so as to increase their horse power. P1 required new suspension be applied to the rear fault axle as well as a new front axle and fitted with steering brakes. Its horsepower was increased to 1000 hp, two to three times the normal capacity. Truckweld co-ordinated the modification. P2 was the largest and most detailed modification of all the trucks for the film Licence to Kill (1989). Apparently, it had not been done before and the process involved electronic engines and two throttle steer peddles being able to operate independently of one another. Truckweld co-ordinated the modification. Although a rig was constructed to help the 18 wheeler truck tilt onto its side, it wasn't necessary as the stunt driver was able to pull off the stunt without the aid of camera trickery. P3 had increased horsepower by fitting new turbo charges and injectors. Other vehicles in the scene included a deluxe Maserati and a 2-seat tricycle Cessna 150 crop-duster airplane. The scene was produced by Barbara Broccoli and took 7 weeks to film.

It's got to the point with American critics where if you're not as smart as Plato, your stupid. That seems like a sad way to live your life.

After connecting as pilots, they would slowly begin to understand one another, and before the end would hear each other speaking in their own respective languages. The only remnant of a language barrier between the characters in the film is in the scene where Raleigh talks to Mako in Japanese, surprising her that he knows her home language.

They shot each skinny Steve scene at least four times; once like a normal scene with Evans and his fellow actors in the scene, once with Evans alone in front of a green screen so his element could be reduced digitally, again with everyone in the scene but with Evans absent so that the shrunken Steve could be re-inserted into the scene, and finally with a body double mimicking Evans's actions in case the second technique were required. When Evans had to interact with other characters in the scene, they had to either lower him or raise the other actors on apple boxes or elevated walkways to make skinny Steve shorter in comparison. For close-ups, Evans's fellow actors had to look at marks on his chin that represented where his eyes would be after the shrinking process, and Evans had to look at marks on the tops of the actor's head to represent their eyes. The second technique involved grafting Evans's head onto the body double. This technique was used mostly when Evans was sitting or lying down, or when a minimum of physical acting was required.

Portman also had to receive physical therapy during filming and one of her sessions was incorporated into the final cut.

A promotional video released about the special effects used in the film was also altered so it didn't include aspects of how Lane's face was digitally replaced with Portman's during complicated dance moves Lane was brought in to perform. Choreographer (and Portman's fiancé) Benjamin Millepied counteracted Lane's comments: ""It was so believable, it was fantastic, that beautiful movement quality. There are articles now talking about her dance double [Sarah Lane] that are making it sound like she did a lot of the work, but really she just did the footwork, the fouettés, and one diagonal phrase in the studio. Honestly, 85% of that movie is Natalie"". Director Darren Aronofsky also debunked Lane's claims: ""Here is the reality. I had my editor count shots.

159	The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) 	"Originally conceived as ""Spider-Man 4,"" a direct sequel to the original film trilogy, Sony Pictures had actually begun pre-production before opting to make this film as a reboot instead. Sony re-negotiated contracts with director Sam Raimi and stars Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst (each receiving a reported $30 million) for a three picture deal with the intention of starting a new trilogy in the series. Scripts were commissioned from writers James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent, David Koepp and Gary Ross, with each writer earning upwards of $1 million or more for their services. The story would have introduced the Vulture as a new villain: Raimi initially approached Ben Kingsley for the role before casting John Malkovich. Malkovitch was actually slated to play Norman Osborne in the original film series, but had to withdraw due to scheduling conflicts. In addition to the Vulture, the film would also introduce the villainess Felicia Hardy, with Anne Hathaway set to play the character. In the initial story, Hardy would become her comic book alter-ego Black Cat, though later script rewrites recreated Hardy as an original character called Vulturess (after her departure, Hathaway would take on a similar role in The Dark Knight Rises (2012)). Raimi also expressed interest in having Dylan Baker return as Dr. Curt Connors, who would transform into the villain The Lizard, though Executive Producer Avi Arad vetoed this idea. With development costs skyrocketing in excess of $100 million, Raimi unhappy with repeated versions of the script, and tensions rising between Raimi, Maguire and the studio, Sony opted (in January 2010) to cancel the film and reboot the series instead. Raimi, for his part, has said it was for the best, as the director had been unhappy with Spider-Man 3 (2007) citing studio interference, and ""hated"" the storyline concocted for the proposed fourth film.

166	The Wizard of Oz (1939) 	"There are a striking number of coincidences between events in the movie and musical cues (and lyrics) on the 1973 Pink Floyd album, ""Dark Side of the Moon"". It is highly improbable that the band had a print of the movie with them at Abbey Road, and few attempt to claim it to have been deliberate (David Gilmour dismisses it as nonsense), but the coincidences are remarkable nonetheless. If you begin the album on the third roar of the MGM lion (using the NTSC version of the movie, not the 25 fps PAL version which runs a little over 4% faster) the coincidences include (but are not limited to): The line ""balanced on the biggest wave"" comes as Dorothy balances on the fence.The song ""On the Run"" starts as Dorothy falls off the fence.""The Great Gig in the Sky"" begins when the tornado first appears.The song ""Us and Them"" is played when Dorothy meets the Wicked Witch of the West.The line ""black and blue"" is repeated when they are talking to one another (Dorothy in her blue outfit, the Wicked Witch in black).The line ""the lunatic is on the grass..."" coincides with Dorothy meeting the Scarecrow.When we first see Miss Gulch on her bicycle, the song ""Time"" starts with its bells and alarms.Dorothy asks Professor Marvel what else he sees in his crystal ball as the line ""thought I'd something more to say"" comes along in the song ""Time"".As the Scarecrow sings ""If I Only Had a Brain"", Pink Floyd sing ""Brain Damage"".Side 1 of the original vinyl album (up to the end of ""The Great Gig in the Sky"") is exactly as long as the black and white portion of the film.As Dorothy listens to the Tin Man's chest, the album ends with the famous heartbeat sound effect.This phenomenon is known as ""Dark Side of the Rainbow,"" ""Dark Side of Oz,"" and ""The Wizard of Floyd.""

166	The Wizard of Oz (1939) 	"In 1898, Dorothy Louise Gage was born to the brother and sister-in-law of Maud Gage Baum, wife of author L. Frank Baum. When little Dorothy died exactly five months later, Maud was heartbroken. Baum was just finishing ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"" and, to comfort his wife, named his heroine after Dorothy, changing her last name to Gale in his second book. Dorothy Gage was buried in Evergreen Memorial Cemetery in Bloomington, Illinois, where her grave was forgotten until 1996 when it was rediscovered. When Mickey Carroll, one of the last existing Munchkins from the movie, learned of the discovery, he was eager to replace her deteriorated grave marker with a new one created by his own monument company. The new stone was dedicated in 1997 and the children's section of the cemetery renamed the Dorothy L. Gage Memorial Garden, in the hope that bereaved families would be comforted in thinking of their lost children as being with Dorothy from ""The Wizard of Oz"".

Fleming was afraid that this would damage his relationship with Garland and even told a co-worker he wished that someone would hit him because of how bad he felt, but Garland overheard the conversation and gave him a kiss on the nose to show that she bore no hard feelings. In the film she can still be seen to be stifling a smile between the lines ""Well, of course not"" and ""My, what a fuss you're making"".

The shot were he runs past the moored boat for example; the crew were simply driving by the docks and director John G. Avildsen saw the boat and thought it would make a good visual, so he had Sylvester Stallone simply get out of the van and run along the quays whilst Avildsen himself filmed from the side door. A similar story concerns the famous shot of Rocky jogging through the food market. As he runs, the stall keepers and the people on the sidewalks can clearly be seen looking at him in bemusement. Whilst this works in the context of the film to suggest they're looking at Rocky, in reality, they had no idea why this man was running up and down the road being filmed from a van. During this scene, the famous shot where the stall-owner throws Rocky an orange was completely improvised by the stall owner-himself, who had no idea that a movie was being filmed and that he would be in it.

They agreed, but only on the condition that Stallone continue to work as a writer without a fee and that he work as an actor for scale. After Winkler and Chartoff purchased the film, they took it to United Artists, who envisioned a budget of $2 million, but that was on the basis of using an established star (they particularly wanted Robert Redford, Ryan O'Neal, Burt Reynolds or James Caan). United Artists didn't want Stallone to star, and when Winkler and Chartoff told them that the only way they could get him to sell the screenplay was to agree to cast him, United Artists cut the budget to $1 million, and had Chartoff and Winkler sign agreements that if the film went over budget, they would be personally liable. The final cost of the film was $1.1 million. The $0.1 million came after Chartoff and Winkler mortgaged their homes so as to complete the project.

For the sequel, he intends to revisit the films of his youth, with Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980) having the pivotal inspiration for the film. ""What I loved especially about Empire is that it expanded Star Wars in every direction: emotionally, its scope, characters, fun. It felt like an embellishment and that's the goal."" Dean further explained, ""I find it dangerous to second-guess the audience. I want to make the movie which I want to see. As a kid, I loved films that had a darker side and were emotionally challenging.... 'The Empire Strikes Back' was a big influence. It offered a heightened sense of emotion. It really served as a tonal model."" Dean DeBlois admitted in an interview at the 67th Annual Cannes Film Festival about the improper use of making animated motion picture sequels. ""I think too often animation sequels seem unnecessary. They turn the same five or six characters into another adventure."" Upon accepting the task to write and direct the sequel, DeBlois went to DreamWorks Animation CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg and pitched a completely different approach: ""I told him I was interested if he would consider the idea of a trilogy, because then the first film could serve as a first act in a larger narrative on the way to an overall coming-of-age story where Hiccup would become a wise Viking chief, and we could end on roughly the same concept as Cressida Cowell's book, explaining why the dragons disappeared."" With the decision to set the sequel five years after the events, it would work best for the story and DeBlois' ambition. ""That way, we could avoid the problem that is often faced by sequels where you start with a character who had all his problems seemingly solved in the first film.""

He yet again made some further cuts and submitted it a third time; yet again it was given an ""X"". De Palma refused to cut the film any further to qualify it for an R. He and producer Martin Bregman arranged a hearing with the MPAA. They brought in a panel of experts, including real narcotics officers, who stated that the film was an accurate portrayal of real life in the drug underworld and should be widely seen. This convinced the 20 members of the ratings board to give the third submitted cut of the film an ""R rating"" by a vote of 18-2. However, De Palma surmised that if the third cut of the film was judged an ""R"" than the very first cut should have been an ""R"" as well. He asked the studio if he could release the first cut but was told that he couldn't. However since the Studio execs really didn't know the differences between the different cuts that had been submitted, De Palma released the first cut of the film to theaters anyway. It wasn't until the film had been released on videocassette months later that he confessed that he had released his first unedited and intended version of the film.

When these wishes were not granted, he withdrew his support for Disney and the film. As a result, his name was not included in ""The Art of Aladdin"" book (it makes constant references to ""the voice of the Genie""), and he was not available for the direct-to-video sequel The Return of Jafar (1994) or the Aladdin (1994) TV show (Dan Castellaneta filled in as the voice of the Genie for these productions). In an attempt to get back on good terms with Williams, Walt Disney CEO Michael Eisner apologized to him with a peace offering of an original Pablo Picasso painting. Still angered and feeling betrayed by Disney, Williams would not accept the gift. It was not until Disney chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg was fired and replaced by Joe Roth did Williams return to Disney. Through Roth, a public apology was given. Promises were made to right wrongs, and Williams was so touched that he came back as the Genie for the second direct-to-video sequel, Aladdin and the King of Thieves (1996).

The aim of the ad was to debunk the legend and mythology associated with film fiction spies like James Bond in Skyfall (2012) saying that real life spy work is not ""high-speed chases and shoot-outs"", an average spy is not a ""globe-trotting secret agent"" and that psychological profiles of real life agents show that they are actually ""far more ordinary"".

208	Skyfall (2012) 	"The meaning and relevance of the film's 'Skyfall' title is that it refers to 'Skyfall Lodge' (aka 'Skyfall Glencoe' or 'Skyfall House'), the name of James Bond's Scottish childhood ancestral home. In the Bond books, author Ian Fleming gave his James Bond character a real life lineage to the Bonds of Peckham. The real life Bond family motto ""Orbis non sufficit"" (""The World is not enough"") was used in the novel of On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969) and as a title for the Bond film The World Is Not Enough (1999). The Bond Family Arms were once displayed prominently in St. Giles Church in Camberwell but were destroyed in a fire in the 1800s. Similarly, an explosion of fire is the fate of 'Skyfall' in the film. 'Skyfall' forms the third part of an unofficial trilogy in the James Bond franchise dealing with Bond's ancestry, the first and second parts being On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969) and The World Is Not Enough (1999). Producer Barbara Broccoli has said that the film's 'Skyfall' title ""has some emotional context which will be revealed in the film"".

Interestingly, Jaws from The Spy Who Loved Me (1977) and Moonraker (1979), another villain with a false jaw, is Bardem's favorite Bond villain. Similarly, Sévérine played by Bérénice Marlohe, who is initially represented as an antagonistic femme fatale working with Silva has the distinguishing feature of the the tattoo on her wrist.

Sévérine's predecessors include Jill Masterton (Shirley Eaton) - painted entirely in gold by Oddjob and/or Goldfinger suffocating her skin in Goldfinger (1964), Helga Brandt (Karin Dor) - fed to piranhas by Blofeld in You Only Live Twice (1967), Rosie Carver (Gloria Hendry) - shot by a gun in a scarecrow of Mr Big / Dr Kananga in Live and Let Die (1973), Andrea Anders (Maud Adams) - shot by Scaramanga in The Man with the Golden Gun (1974), Corinne Dufour (Corinne Cléry) - mauled to death by Drax's Doberman dogs after Drax terminates her employment in Moonraker (1979), Paris Carver (Teri Hatcher) - shot by Elliot Carver's assassin Dr. Kaufman in Tomorrow Never Dies (1997), and Solange (Caterina Murino) - tortured, murdered and wrapped in a hammock by Le Chiffre's henchmen in Casino Royale (2006). Those who have survived betraying the villain include Domino (Claudine Auger) in Thunderball (1965), Solitaire (Jane Seymour) in Live and Let Die (1973), and Lupe Lamora (Talisa Soto) in Licence to Kill (1989).

208	Skyfall (2012) 	"Since Daniel Craig was first cast as James Bond he has often had the nickname of 'James Blond' due to his lighter color hair which is markedly different than Bond's usual dark hair. As Javier Bardem sports blond hair in this movie, 'Skyfall' becomes the first film entry in the official series to feature both James Bond and the leading villain with blond hair. Other blond Bond villains include Red Grant in From Russia with Love (1963), Hans in You Only Live Twice (1967), Erich Kriegler in For Your Eyes Only (1981), Venz in A View to a Kill (1985), Necros in The Living Daylights (1987), Peter Franks in Diamonds Are Forever (1971), Stamper in Tomorrow Never Dies (1997) and Goldie in The World Is Not Enough (1999). However, in the official series, Bardem is only the second ever main Bond villain to have blond hair after Christopher Walken as Max Zorin in A View to a Kill (1985). Bardem is the third if one counts Gert Fröbe as the red-blond haired Auric Goldfinger (1964) or the fourth if one counts Klaus Maria Brandauer as Maximillian Largo in the unofficial Never Say Never Again (1983). Bardem's blond hair in the film was not peroxided but was a wig. 'Skyfall''s 2012 release also marks 25 Years since there has been a leading blond Bond Girl who was Kara Milovy (Maryam d'Abo) in The Living Daylights (1987). Since then, the only significant Blonde Bond Girl was the supporting role of Professor Inga Bergstrom (Cecilie Thomsen) in Tomorrow Never Dies (1997).

He and his colleague Ken Sullivan discovered that although Mississippi voted to ratify the amendment in 1995, a clerical oversight caused that vote to remain officially unacknowledged, sine the Mississippi Secretary of State had never sent the vote's result to the U. S. Office of the Federal Register. After Sullivan also saw the movie, both men urged the office of the Mississippi Secretary of State to file that paperwork, which they did on January 30, 2013; on February 7, 2013, the director of the Federal Register confirmed its receipt along with the fact that Mississippi had finally ratified the 13th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.

I can't account for how at any given moment I feel the need to explore one life as opposed to another. But I do know that I can only do this work if I feel almost as if there's no choice; that a subject coincides inexplicably with a very personal need and a very specific moment in time. In this case, as fascinated as I was by 'Abe,' it was the fascination of a grateful spectator who longed to see a story told rather than that of a participant. That's how I feel now in spite of myself, and though I can't be sure this won't change, I couldn't dream of encouraging you to keep it open on a mere possibility. I do hope this makes sense Steven. I'm glad you're making the film. I wish you the strength for it and I send both my very best wishes and my sincere gratitude to you for having considered me. Daniel.""

The two men were elected to the Presidency 100 years apart (1860, 1960). Lincoln took it upon himself to end slavery, while Kennedy's time in office was marked by the Civil Rights Movement. Both men had southern Vice Presidents named Johnson. Lincoln was shot at the Ford's Theatre by an actor named John Wilkes Booth. Kennedy was riding in a Ford Lincoln Mercury when he was shot by Lee Harvey Oswald, who hid out in a movie theatre. This film adds two more similarities to the mix: it was produced by Kathleen Kennedy, and features Tommy Lee Jones, who also appeared in JFK (1991). Daniel Day-Lewis appeared in Gandhi (1982) with Martin Sheen, who played John F. Kennedy in 'Kennedy (1983)(TV)'. Sally Field played Sheen's wife in The Amazing Spider-Man (2012).

Consequently, Kit Harington undertook a heavy 'bulking' regimen and a diet of 3000 calories a day to put on 2 stones (12.7kg/28lbs) of weight in 5 weeks.

306	How to Train Your Dragon (2010) 	"The film was originally intended to end with Hiccup largely unscathed after the climactic battle. However, the directors decided that it would not feel believable that the heroes could defeat such a formidable foe like the Red Death Dragon without great cost. With that in mind, they decided to have the boy lose part of his left leg at the end of the battle in a deliberate parallel to how Toothless the Dragon lost his left tail fin earlier in the film. Whatever concerns about how parents would react to the hero of a family film being so maimed were settled in the film's test screenings. Parents in the audience told the producers on their own accord that they approved of that story development and requested that it be kept in the final edit. In addition, the original book's author, Cressida Cowell, praised this ending and considered it true to the spirit of her book. Furthermore, the scene originally had Hiccup alone as he comes to grips with his wound. However, when Steven Spielberg saw the original footage, he felt that Hiccup and Toothless' interaction in the film's final act had been reduced to something like a mere cowboy and his horse. So, he suggested that Toothless be with the boy in that particular scene so as to reinforce the idea that their companionship was far deeper than that.

Furthermore, Toothless the dragon in the book is about the size of the Terrible Terror breed, and he is also green and red, not black. Toothless also got his name because when Hiccup first found him he had no teeth. He grew one tooth, only to lose it shortly later. The producers decided, with the approval of author Cressida Cowell, that it would be more cinematic to make Toothless large enough to be ridden as a flying mount. As such, Toothless was completely redesigned as a rare Night Fury, a highly intelligent breed of dragon evolved for speed and stealth. His personal name in the film derives from Hiccup's observation about how his teeth are normally retracted into his jaws so they don't interfere with his fire breathing, which is typically projected as an explosive pulse.

He even feels the body before being sure of what he is dealing with since he can't see anything.Just before finding the doors hiding the dead body, he runs into an end table with his thigh, as if he didn't see it.As he walks along the highway with Solara, he silences her so that he can hear better the bird (""dinner"") flying above them.At George and Martha's house, he kicks forward by the first step of the stairs to the porch with his boot so he knows where it is.He never fires his weapon first, needing to hear the sound of shooting at him to identify the location of his target.His use of a shotgun as a primary weapon means that accuracy is not as critical, allowing for him to aim via sound rather than sight.When Eli and Solara approach the cannibals' (George and Martha) house. As they approach the steps, you can hear a brief clicking sound. Eli is using echolocation to ""see"" what is ahead of him.George asks Eli about the No Trespassing sign, ""Can't you read the sign?""

Eventually, Conan becomes a king. In real life, Schwarzenegger was born in a small Austrian village and spent his life bodybuilding. He then becomes famous and wealthy through bodybuilding competitions and action/adventure movies. Schwarzenegger engaged in drug use and womanizing in his past, but gave those up later in life and then campaigned for social causes. Eventually, he was elected Governor of California.

In 1994, Linklater started shooting ""Before Sunrise"" and when the world premiere was about to take place, Linklater was secretly hoping that Amy would show up but she did not. Ten years later, Linklater shot the sequel Before Sunset (2004) and had yet to hear from Amy. Finally, in 2010, a friend of Amy's who knew about their story, contacted Linklater to tell him that Amy had died in a motorcycle accident on May 9, 1994 at the age of 24 and even a few weeks before he started shooting Before Sunrise (1995). Both Linklater and Hawke were devastated but found comfort in the inspiration for the Before Trilogy.

After doing three takes of Rocky taking shots to ribs, Stallone felt a burning in his chest, but ignored it. Later that night, he had difficulty breathing and was taken to a nearby emergency room. It was discovered that his blood pressure was over 200, and he had to be flown on a low-altitude flight from Canada to St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, where he remained in intensive care for eight days. What had happened was that Lungren had punched him so hard in the chest, Stallone's heart had slammed up against his breastbone and began to swell, cutting off the blood supply and restricting the oxygen flow throughout the body.

When Samantha asks when she can have kids, Donnie says: ""Not until 8th grade."" Donnie mentions to his therapist that his dog Callie died when he was eight. (He is later seen holding a stuffed toy dog in her office.) Donnie jokes about the Back to the Future (1985) DeLorean which had a speed of 88 MPH. According to the television reporter, the fire at Jim Cunningham's house was extinguished ""sometime after 8:00 last night."" The red-eye flight that almost crashes is Flight 2806 which boards at Gate 42 at 12 AM. The climax of Donnie Darko occurs one week before the 1988 US presidential election, when George Bush won on November 8, 1988 [11/08/88]. The movie was shot (for a budget of less than US$5 million) in 28 days. There are 28 scenes in the director's cut of this film.

A deleted scene verifies that Hobo is indeed a ghost. The multiple roles of Tom Hanks are not simply an artistic choice but they intentionally constitute some symbolic undertones in the plot. Santa Claus, the Conductor and the Hobo represent the Holy Trinity and the trip to the North Pole is a test of the Hero Boy's faith since he expresses some doubts about the existence of Santa Claus who stands for God. The Conductor symbolizes Christ who continually tries to keep the children inside the train and ensures that the locomotive will not deviate (meaning that he guides the Christians at the right path). Finally the Hobo is the incarnate of the Holy Ghost in reference to the fact that he is a spirit who guides the Hero Boy testing continually his faith and giving him options.

The pilots also, like in the film, rolled the airplane to an inverted position to try and halt the dive. Unlike the film, however, this did not assist them in recovering the aircraft. In the real life accident, the root cause was found to be inadequate maintenance that made the jackscrew that controls the stabilizer wear down and jam. Eventually the treads of the jackscrew were ripped out, the stabilizer flipped up and the plane became uncontrollable.

548	The Karate Kid (1984) 	"According to black belt karate instructor William (Bill) J. DeClemente in ""Black Belt"" magazine dated May 1994, DeClemente believed he was the inspiration for The Karate Kid (1984) character. He was 17 years old when he started training in karate in 1963 in Queens, New York, the same neighborhood where screenwriter Robert Mark Kamen started training in karate in 1965. Kamen came to watch DeClemente teach in 1965 before enrolling at a karate school in Queens taught by Ed McGrath. Kamen has acknowledged in a sworn deposition that the tough ex-marine he depicted as John Kreese in the film was patterned after Ed McGrath, who was also a friend of DeClemente. DeClemente also said Kamen probably based Mr. Miyagi after Okinawan karate legend Chojun Miyagi. However, Kamen refused to acknowledge DeClemente as the basis of the karate kid character, in which DeClemente is the owner of the registered nationally trademark name ""The Karate Kid"" since the mid-1960s and was known locally in Queens, Brooklyn, and Florida and to his business associates. This led to DeClemente suing Columbia Pictures Industries, Jerry Weintraub Productions, and Jerry Weintraub on July 29, 1994 for trademark infringement, violation of his right of publicity claims, and seeking damages for three Karate Kid films. [Case: DeClemente v. Columbia Pictures, 860 F. Supp. 30 (E.D.N.Y. 1994)]. DeClement's case was dismissed, ruling in favor of the defendants. The court viewed the films did not damage the plaintiff, DeClemente, in a legal sense and that his public personality as the Karate Kid was not notorious enough that the public identified him exclusively with this persona as well as no evidence adduced that the defendants knew the plaintiff, until the year 1990. On his official website, DeClemente still maintains the claim that he is the inspiration for screenwriter Robert Mark Kamen of the films that bears his registered nationally trademarked name, ""The Karate Kid"".

565	The Crow (1994) 	"Brandon Lee died during a mishap on the set. A scene required a gun to be loaded, cocked, and then pointed at the camera. Because of the close-range of the shot, the dummy cartridges loaded had real brass caps, bullet, but no powder. After the cut, the props master (not the arms master - he had left the set for the day) dry-fired the gun to get the cock off, knocking the projectile/bullet into the barrel of the gun. The next scene to be filmed involving that gun was the rape of Shelly. The gun was loaded with blanks (which usually contain double or triple the powder of a normal cartridge to make a loud noise). Lee entered the set carrying a bag of groceries containing an explosive blood pack. The script called for Funboy (Michael Massee) to shoot Eric Draven (Lee) as he entered the room, triggering the blood pack. The bullet that was stuck in the barrel was blasted at Lee through the bag he was carrying, killing him. The footage of his death was subsequently developed and used as evidence in the investigation into his death. As part of the lawsuit settlement, the footage was later destroyed. Lee is the son of martial arts legend Bruce Lee, who died in mysterious circumstances before completing Game of Death (1978). See also Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story (1993).

572	Hercules (1997) 	"There are many differences between the film and the original myths. Among them are: 1. Hera wasn't actually Hercules' mother. While Zeus was his father, his mother was a mortal named Alcmene, which made him a demi-god. Hercules was conceived when Zeus disguised himself as Alcmene's husband Amphitryon, who was away to fight in a war. Zeus' wife Hera, furious over her husband's adultery, swore vengeance, and bestowed misfortune over Hercules wherever and whenever she could. In the movie, Alcmene and her husband adopt Baby Hercules.2. The Fates do not share an eye. The Graeae, perpetually old women who helped Perseus find Medusa, shared an eye.3. Pegasus was created by the blood of Medusa, not clouds (as seen in the film) on Olympus.4. Zeus did not bestow the underworld on Hades but the two, along with Poseidon, drew lots.5. In the movie, Hades releases the Titans from a place at the bottom of the ocean, but in the original myth they were banished to Tartarus, which is in the deepest and worst section of the underworld.6. The Cyclops, although brother to the Titans, was not a Titan.7. The Titans say Zeus put them there, but Zeus's grandfather Uranus did. Zeus freed the Cyclops along with Giants and creatures called Hundred-Handed Ones, and he was given the gift of thunder and lightning as a token of appreciation.7. Narcissus is not a Greek God, and therefore would not be on Mount Olympus.8. Megara was Hercules' first wife, with whom he had children; however, Hera induced a fit of rage and madness in him, during which he killed them all. To repent for these sins, Hercules performed all of his heroic deeds (most of them are seen, mentioned or referred to in the movie). It is his later wife Deianara who Hercules saves from the river guardian Nessos; in revenge, Nessos gives Deianara a poisonous shirt, saying it will make Hercules love her more. Unsuspecting, she later gives him the shirt, believing his love for her is waning. The shirt clings to Hercules' skin and causes him agonizing pains. He builds a funeral pyre and sits on top of it, begging his friends to set it on fire and end his misery. No one can bring himself to do it, except for Philoctetes (who was a man and not a satyr). Upon death, Zeus deifies Hercules and admits him onto Olympus.

This marked the first time that the studio had lost money on an animated film since Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas (2003). As a result of this combined with other factors, in February 2013, the studio announced it was laying off 350 employees as part of a company-wide restructuring. If had The Croods (2013) bombed even worse than Guardians, the studio would lay off even more employees and might face the potential possibility of a bankruptcy. The Croods (2013) then opened on March 22, 2013 to glowing positive reviews and widely enthusiastic acclaim from audiences, eventually earning more than $186 million in the U.S. and over $583 million worldwide, earning its place to be sixth highest grossing film of the year (so far), besting Oz the Great and Powerful (2013), Pacific Rim (2013), Star Trek Into Darkness (2013), and World War Z (2013). It remarkably helped DreamWorks' earnings rise higher from $162.8 million to $213.4 million in the second quarter of 2013 - one of the best financial earnings ever received in the company's history.

(1933). Also in 1970, Peter O'Toole was nominated for playing Chipping in Goodbye, Mr. Chips (1969), a role that won Robert Donat an Oscar for 1939's Goodbye, Mr. Chips (1939). It happened again in the 1970s when Marlon Brando and Robert De Niro each won Oscars for playing Vito Corleone (in The Godfather (1972) and The Godfather: Part II (1974), respectively). The fifth occurrence was when Gérard Depardieu, was nominated for the title role in Cyrano de Bergerac (1990), a role that had already won an Oscar for José Ferrer (1950's Cyrano de Bergerac (1950)). The sixth was when Cate Blanchett was nominated for playing Queen Elizabeth I in 1998 and 2008 in Elizabeth (1998) and Elizabeth: The Golden Age (2007), respectively, a role that won Judi Dench an Oscar in 1998 for Shakespeare in Love (1998). John Wayne won Best Actor for playing Rooster Cogburn in the original True Grit (1969). The original True Grit, and the first two Godfathers, all featured Robert Duvall as well, who appeared with Jeff Bridges the previous year in his Oscar-winning role in Crazy Heart (2009).

691	The Thing (1982) 	"When the dog is penned in the animal cage with other dogs, its cellmates show no concern or reaction. The ""esp"" of most animals is known to be sensitive. Ordinarily, animals which are confined with a creature which is unknown to them, become wary and behave in a manner which indicates they feel threatened. Although the alien nature of the dog is hidden inside its appearance, the dog's cellmates would likely have caused a fearful response instead of the laid-back behavior shown when the dog-Thing was first placed in the animal cage. That the dogs truly become alarmed when the dog-Thing begins to manifest its true nature is predictable, but the wariness of the dogs might have been made more evident when the dog was first caged, even if merely a curious glance by one dog or shifting of another dog to a more guarded position. There may not be an actual error, but many animals show caution when they know ""something is up"", and become very reluctant to approach or tolerate a suspicious creature in close quarters to them. Also, one animal among a group which becomes alarmed when confronted by something, which, although familiar in appearance, has bizarre qualities which could only be detected by another animal with similar sensory skills, would probably generate excitement that would spread to the other dogs within earshot.

Both hired agents to perform an illegal task (i.e. John Clark) and took steps to separate themselves from the agents. Both were caught using then-modern media: for Nixon it was hidden tape recordings in his office, and for Bennett it was a computer file. Once caught, both attempted to claim that the President's authority would overrule the investigation: Ritter's ""get out of jail free card"" is a letter signed by the President, and Nixon attempted not to release the incriminating tape recordings citing ""executive privilege"" (the Supreme Court later ruled this void). Both were investigated by Congress directly, and though Bennett's fate is unknown, Nixon resigned to avoid a certain impeachment and a likely conviction. The most poignant parallel between Bennett and Nixon is this: Bennett tells Adm. Cutter, ""The gloves come off,"" while Nixon once said, ""This is the time and this is the place to take off the gloves and sock it to 'em!""

This is a relic of 1994, when the internet was fledgling and most people didn't have email or anything that required a password on their personal computers. By 2000, email and other online accounts had blossomed, and more people were aware that simple passwords weren't a good idea. In 2010 meanwhile, most websites have requirements on ""password entropy"" and reject outright such simple passwords as too easy to crack. On a side note, as a member of the CIA, Ritter probably had a ""cryptocard"" or other device that told him what his password was when he logged in, and changed every hour or every minute.

Another camper, Alex Hollins, is weighed by Tony during the midpoint of camp, and it is revealed he neither gained nor lost weight. 6. A scene where Gerry, Roy, Josh, and Nicholas are preparing to do their beginning of the year physical with Nurse Julie, and they talk about getting boners. 7. An extended version of the campers swimming in the lake under Lars's supervision--this includes a scene where Gerry asks Lars about the Blob, a scene where Nurse Julie talks to Pat, who is scrubbing graffiti from Camp MVP, and the campers see the dismantled go-karts and are told by Tony it would be replaced by an obstacle course called PUOC. 8. A scene in the Chipmunk bunk where the campers talk about the sit-up game (done later in the movie to foil Tony during the hike) and experiment it on Lars, who, when doing the sit-up, pushes Josh across the cabin. 9. Two versions of the Camp Hope campfire, both of wish begin with Pat and Tim singing about Camp Hope under Tony's leadership. Tony and Lars interrupt the campfire with Tony discussing sacrifice, obesity, and smuggling illegal candy into the camp. Tony urges the campers to throw all candy into the fire, and when nobody volunteers, he then raids the cabins to search for candy. 10. An extended version of the bunk raid scene where Tony asks a camper, Philip, to unzip his pants where it is revealed that he had a 3 Musketeers in his pants. This version also includes the infamous Peter Fitz joke given by Josh. 11. Additional dialogue about Josh's whereabouts from the lunch line. This scene also shows the cafeteria workers warning Pat for giving the campers large servings. 12. An extended scene of Tim talking to Tony before the Camp MVP baseball game. Pat then approaches Tony, asking him to be reassigned to the Chipmunk bunk, but Tony tells Pat that he should stay away from the campers given his weight. 13. An extended scene of Gerry crying at the end of the Camp MVP baseball game--he ends up running away from the game and sees Lars harpooning the Blob. 14. An alternate scene of Gerry writing a letter, but this one was to his parents and full of sarcastic comments, such as saying how he sees the nurse all the time, how he has made friends playing baseball with the Camp MVP kids, and how he has enjoyed the Blob. This scene also contains an alternate version of Tony on a bed of nails. 15. A scene where the campers perform a play featuring Roy as a drunken bum getting a fish bone and the other characters playing alley cats. 16. Two versions of a scene where Nurse Julie visits Tony, and she snoops around his cabin and criticizes his weight loss program and personality. Tony tells her that ""pain is the ultimate tool for shifting a belief,"" citing various motivational speakers. 17. An extended version of the campers searching Tony's cabin and an extended version of Tony running and working out around camp. The campers learn Tony is interested in the money from the infomercial, and Nicholas smuggles ginseng, rice cakes, and bulking agent from the cabin. 18. An extended version of the 20-mile hike, featuring junior counselor Dawson thanking Gerry for not ratting him out for smuggling food, an alternate version of the Icarus/Sisyphus story, a scene where they walk over an underground ant farm, as well as an extended version of Tony working out on the top of a mountain. 19. A scene where Tony, after being imprisoned, talk some wisdom to Sam, who was standing guard, and encourages him to let him out.

An extended version of the Camp Hope or Camp Hell video, which includes more dialogue between Tony and Josh where Tony coaches Josh to say positive things about the camp. Josh criticizes the food, leading to alternate takes, and when he tells Tony he's been at the camp longer, Tony makes him do 120 push-ups. The film also shows Tony prepping the campers for a small 30 minute run where he taunts the campers and tells them to run with their heels up to their butt. It also has extended footage of Josh and Roy eating a rat and ends with Gerry introducing Nurse Julie, who gives her disapproval of Tony's program. 22. An extended version of Tony invading Parents Day. After he loses his balance in the auditorium, he reaches for a bow and arrow, aims it at Mr. Garner, and talks about how his own father never showed him any affection. 23. Extra footage of Camp Hope after Pat takes over, including his stealing Camp MVP's boat motor to use in the go-kart for the Apache Relay and a scene where he has sex with Nurse Julie on a boat. 24. The Apache Relay scene is extended to show many more events including Pat and Lars giving the campers a motivational talk and Gerry thinking Camp Hope would get creamed. It is revealed that MVP picked 15 events and Hope picked 15 and each event had a time limit such that the participant would automatically advance if time ran out. Other events featured in the deleted scenes but not in the film itself were an obstacle course, a t-ball derby, a canoe race, a belly flop contest, an A/V obstacle course involving the camper running a projector through a simulated hallway and setting up the film, Tim (in a Southern accent) reading Shakespeare passages in the Hall of Intelligence, and a segment where the Hall of Intelligence participant had to skip to the next event (the Grand Prix). Also, at the end of the film, Chris from Camp MVP files a formal protest because he realized Pat stole his boat motor to use as the Camp Hope go kart motor. 25. Alternate versions of Tony selling items door-to-door including mail-order meat, Chinese herbal healing remedies, and South American massage balls.

The young actor was shown how to handle the pig ahead of time by the trainer. The stream was very shallow and was checked out ahead of time by the trainer to make sure it was safe for the pig and the young actor to walk in and drink from. Another grown pig appeared at the end of the scene to make it appear as if the piglet was now grown. A trainer attached a halter that fit around the pigs' front legs and neck. The young actor was given the end of the rope, which he held while delivering his dialogue. The actor then gently tugged on the rope to get the pig to walk with him. A trainer stood off camera holding a bucket of grain and calling to the pig to encourage it to walk in that direction. The sounds of the pig squealing and grunting were sound effects added in during post-production.

Rule #25: You understand she heard that, but that's not what you meant.  Rule #26: Of course you love her.  Rule #27: Don't over drink. The machinery must work in order to close.  Rule #28: Make sure there's an open bar.  Rule #29: Always be a team player. Everyone needs a little help now and again.  Rule #30: Know the playbook so you can call an audible.  Rule #31: If you call an audible, always make sure your fellow Crashers know.  Rule #32: Don't commit to a relative unless you're absolutely sure that they have a pulse.  Rule #33: Never go back to your place.  Rule #34: Be gone by sunrise.  Rule #35: Breakfast is for closers.  Rule #36: Your favorite movie is ""The English Patient"".  Rule #37: At the reception, one hard drink or two beers max. A drunk crasher is a sloppy crasher.  Rule #38: Never hit on the bride! It's a one-way ticket to the pavement.  Rule #39: The way to a woman's bed is through the dance floor.  Rule #40: Dance with old folks and the kids. The girls will think you're ""sweet.""  Rule #41: Try not to break anything, unless you're not having fun.  Rule #42: At the service, sit in the fifth row. It's close enough to wedding party to seem like you're an invited guest. Never sit in the back. The back row just smells like crashing.  Rule #43: Create an air of mystery that involves some painful experience when interacting with the girl you're after, but don't talk about it. Allude to it. Then walk away, She'll follow.  Rule #44: Always remember your fake name!  Rule #45: The Rules of Wedding Crashing are sacred. Don't sully them by ""improvising.""  Rule #46: You forgot your invitation in your rush to get to the church.  Rule #47: Make sure all the single women at the wedding know you're there because you've just suffered either a terrible breakup or the death of your fiancée.  Rule #48: Always work the following into a conversation: ""Yeah, I have tons of money. But how does one buy happiness?""  Rule #49: Be pensive! It draws out the ""healer"" in women.  Rule #50: Always pull out in time.  Rule #51: Tell any woman you're interested in that you'd love to stay, but you promised to help out at the homeless shelter today.  Rule #52: Get choked up during the service. The girls will think you're ""sensitive"". Bring a slice of onion or artificial tears if necessary.  Rule #53: Avoid virgins. They're too clingy.  Rule #54: If pressed, tell people you're related to Uncle Ned. Everyone has an Uncle Ned.  Rule #55: Don't fixate on one woman. ALWAYS have a back-up.  Rule #56: When seeing a rival crasher, do not interact. Merely acknowledge each other with a tug on the earlobe and gracefully move on.  Rule #57: The Ferrari's in the shop.  Rule #58: If two rival crashers pick the same girl, the crasher with the least seniority will respectfully yield.  Rule #59: No ""chicken dancing"" - no exceptions.  Rule #60: When crashing out of state, request permission from a local Wedding Crasher chapter.  Rule #61: No more than two weddings a weekend. More and your game gets sloppy.  Rule #62: Bring an extra umbrella when it rains. Courtesy opens more legs than charm.  Rule #63: Always save room for cake.  Rule #64: When your crash partner fails, you fail. No man is an island.  Rule #65: Smile! You're having the time of your life.  Rule #66: Mix it up a little. You can't always be the man with the haunted past.  Rule #67: No sex on the altar. Confessionals, okay. Chair lofts, better.  Rule #68: Two shut-outs in a row? It's time to take a week off. Ask yourself: what is getting in the way of my happiness?  Rule #69: Research, research, research the wedding party. And when you are done researching, research some more.  Rule #70: Studies show that women have a more developed sense of smell. Breath mints: small cost, big yield.  Rule #71: No excuses. Play like a champion!  Rule #72: In case of emergency, refer to the playbook.  Rule #73: Gilrs in hats tend to be proper and rarely give it up.  Rule #74: Keep interactions with the parents of the bride to a minimum.  Rule #75: Carry extra protection.  Rule #76: The unmarried female rabbi - is she fair game? Of course she is.  Rule #77: The tables furthest from the kitchen always get served dinner first.  Rule #78: Stop, look, listen. At weddings. In life.  Rule #79: Occasionally bring a real gift. You're getting sex without having to buy dinner, so you can afford a blender.  Rule #80: Always think ahead, but always stay in the moment. Reconcile this paradox and you'll not only get the girl, you might also get peace of mind.  Rule #81: Don't let the ring bearer bum your smokes. His parents may start to ask questions.  Rule #82: Stay clear of the wedding planner. They may recognize you and start to wonder.  Rule #83: Don't use the ""I have two months to live"" bit - not cool, not effective.  Rule #84: Shoes say a lot about a man.  Rule #85: Always choose large weddings. More choice. Easier to blend.  Rule #86: You're from out of town. ALWAYS.  Rule #87: Know something about the place you say you are from. Texas is played out. For some reason, New Hampshire seems to work.  Rule #88: Of course you dream of one day having children.  Rule #89: Never dance to ""What I Like About You."" It's long past time to let that song go. Someone will request it at every wedding. Don't dance to it. No matter how hot she is.  Rule #90: Tell the bride's friends and family that you are family of the groom and vice-versa.  Rule #91: Only take one car. You never know when you'll need to make a fast escape.  Rule #92: Deep down, most people hate themselves. This knowledge is the key to most bedroom doors.  Rule #93: Try not to show off on the dance floor. That means you Jeremy.  Rule #94: Etiquette isn't old-fashioned, it's sexy.  Rule #95: Catholic weddings - the classic dilemma: painfully long ceremony, horny girls.  Rule #96: The newspaper Wedding Announcements are your racing form. Choose carefully.  Rule #97: Be judicious with cologne. Citrus tones are best.  Rule #98: Save the tuxes for ""the big show"" only.  Rule #99: Avoid women who were psychology majors in college.  Rule #100: No periwinkle colored ties, please.  Rule #101: Always have an early ""appointment"" the next morning.  Rule #102: Be well groomed and well-mannered.  Rule #103: Never cockblock a fellow crasher. Cockblocking an invited guest is okay.  Rule #104: Eat plentiful, digest your food. You'll need the energy for later.  Rule #105: Know when to abandon ship if it ain't floating.  Rule #106: Know your swing and salsa dancing. Girls love to get twisted around.  Rule #107: Always carry an assortment of placecards to match any wedding design.  Rule #108: Make sure your magic trick and balloon animal skills are not rusty. If the kids love it, the girls will too.  Rule #109: Never reveal your true identity.  Rule #110: Never walk away from a crasher in a funny jacket.  By decree of Chazz Reingold, Creator of the Rules of Wedding Crashing, revised from 1989 in October 2004, the following bits of slang are no longer acceptable: ""it's all good,"" ""hey, no worries,"" and any sentence that involves anyone getting ""their freak on.""
